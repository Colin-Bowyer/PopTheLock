# PopTheLock

## Rules

This is a clone of the arcade game Pop the Lock. Toggle the switch either direction to start, and then press either button when the player(white light) is over the target (red light). Pressing a button will cause you to switch direction, but if you switch direction when not over a target or pass a target without pressing a button, you lose. After you lose, you will return to the main menu(all lights are off). Your score, the number of targets you hit, will be saved as your high score. You can press a button to print the high score to the serial monitor, or toggle the switch to start another round.

## Inputs/Outputs

The buttons ans switches are the only inputs. Currently, the lights are the only output, but sound will be added later. The speaker will communicate the high score and play sounds when scoring or losing.
